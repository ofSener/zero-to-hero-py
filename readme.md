#This readme is about my learning journey and notes about the things I learn

## 1.
i created weather-api.py file and tried to use openai api but i failed to use it.
i thought it is free but i was wrong.
i search lots of things about openai api and i lost some time.
i wont try to use openai api until i learn more about it.

i learned something about .gitingnore and .env files.
